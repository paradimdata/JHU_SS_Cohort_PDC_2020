## Materials Data Science Tools for Novel Phenomena

#### Welcome to the GitHub repo for the 2020 PARADIM Summer School, "Hands-Off Hands-On"... our virtual way of providing hands-on content during this Summer of Social Distancing. 
This repo will be home to a variety of shared resources and serve as a place to build familiarity with git and GitHub as useful, centralized tools for collarboration and sharing resources.

Content will change during the week, but will be locked and versioned at the end of the Summer School to allow minting a DOI for finability and future sharing.

Here's a rough plan for the week:

### Monday
 (Introduction, FAIR, Jupyter/Bash in the SciServer Infrastructure, Git and GitHub, Plotting and Data Wrangling, Partner Match, **develop homework** 
### Tuesday
(Data Centric Methods in Materials, Metadata and Automated Processing, Introduction to Machine Learning, Database APIs (Jarvis, Materials Project, OQMD, etc.), homework, **problem identification**
### Wednesday
(Using Jarvis, MARCC in Notebooks, Aiida Notebooks)
### Thursday
(Report Backs, Presentation Planning, presenting in notebooks, problem revision, Presentation Work)
### Friday
**Presentations!**
